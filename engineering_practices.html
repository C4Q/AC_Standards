    <li>Conceptual understanding of GitHub collaboration and best practices (at least: the difference between Git and GitHub, QA/feature branches versus master branch, the importance of readme files, the pull request/review/approval cycle, how to avoid merge conflicts)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Accordingly, we expect students to be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create GitHub accounts and link them to their Git installations in the command line</li>
    <li>Create, clone, and remove Git repositories anywhere they have permission to on their systems</li>

    <li>See changes, commits, and commit history in the command line and revert to previous commits if necessary</li>
    <li>Pull updates from a remote repository</li>
    <li>Create, update, checkout, and push branches</li>
    <li>Submit, annotate, comment on, and approve pull requests on GitHub</li>
  </ul>
</details>




<h3>Debugging</h3>
<h2>iOS Debugging</h2>
<p>We expect fellows to understand the process by which to use debugging tools like breakpoints, instruments in fixing bugs in your app. Understand the following tools and terminology:</p>

<p>Using breakpoints</p>
<p>Symbolicated crash reports vs Unsymbolicated crash reports</p>
<p>Finding and using crash reports</p>
<p>Managing performance and memory</p>

<details>
<summary>Web</summary>
<ul>
  <li>Utilize online resources (e.g. the curriculum, Stack Overflow, MDN, Google) to ameliorate gaps in understanding and address bugs in code</li>
  <li>Utilize developer tools (e.g. Chrome's developer tools, Postman, online code formatters) to test functionalities in full stack web projects</li>
</ul>
</details>

<h3>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving<sub> 1<sub></h3>
<p><strong>EP. </strong>Identify a problem or challenge, conceptualize a way (or multiple ways) to approach it, consider potential effects of additional factors, and test different solutions until they find one that works. Break down complex problems into their component parts, form hypotheses to test them, consider the effects of additional factors, and eliminate potential problems one by one.
</p>

<p><strong>EP. </strong>Know how to find a plausible answer independently: Identify essential requirements that define the answer that needs to be solved, based on users, stakeholders, and constraints, single out missing information and determine the best way to find it, whether through existing resources, an online search, available libraries, etc., sort through varied information to determine what’s useful and reliable, and use those resources to learn something new, figure out a problem, and/ or locate additional helpful resources.</p>

<p>Deal effectively with dead ends, frustration: Demonstrate ability to overcome frustration effectively. When one approach doesn’t work, rather than becoming despondent or giving up, able to take a step back, regroup, and try a different way.<p>

    <p>Know when, and how, to ask for help from their peers/instructor when they've exhausted their independent resources</p>

<p>Strong desire and ability to learn: Demonstrate the desire and ability to find and learn new material. Must be able to conduct effective research (find and sort through various resources to find useful, reliable information) and teach themselves new material in an ever-evolving  field. This includes learning and being able to apply new languages to solve business problems.<p>

<ul>
  <li>Utilize online resources (e.g. the curriculum, Stack Overflow, MDN, Google) to ameliorate gaps in understanding and address bugs in code</li>
</ul>

  <p>Understanding dense technical material: Many technical professions require an ability to read dense technical material. It’s important for individuals to be able to read documentation with attention and rigor and accurately pick out and apply important information.<p>

<p>Curiosity: Part of being a good problem-solver is an inherent curiosity that drives people to want to uncover and overcome new frontiers in the  rst place. As a result, many employers look for an indication of curiosity in their employees, and may ask di erent types of questions to gauge this during an interview, from review of tech-related personal/side projects and non-tech extracurriculars to inquiries about a candidate’s reading list.</p>


  <h3>The Command Line</h3>
  <p>We expect students to know all important terms and concepts related to the basic implementation and usage of the bash terminal, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The difference between a CLI and a GUI</li>
    <li>Basic filesystem navigation and manipulation (at least: 'ls', 'cd', 'touch', 'mkdir', 'rm')</li>
    <li>System-level environment variables - what they are and how to manipulate them (more on this in the Node section)</li>
    <li>Basic bash commands (e.g. 'sudo', 'which') and shorthand (at least: '-v', '-u', '-a', '--help')</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Accordingly, we expect students to be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Navigate to any folder/file in the terminal when asked</li>
    <li>Create a file/folder anywhere they have permission to in their filesystem</li>
    <li>Install any software with command line support and be able to utilize it with documentation</li>
    <li>Discern what software they have installed globally, what version it is, and how to update/uninstall/reinstall as necessary</li>
  </ul>


    <h3>Local Development</h3>
    <p>We expect students to know how to set up and maintain their local development environments, including:</p>

      <li>Installing, configuring, updating, and using technologies important to the local implementation of full-stack web apps (for example, NPM, Express, Postgres, React, Postman, testing frameworks, deployment tools, mock data generators).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Accordingly, we expect students to be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Independently set up and operate a development environment on a new computer</li>
      <li>Utilize tools to effectively debug/test full-stack web applications</li>
