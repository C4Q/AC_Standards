# Pursuit - Access Code

## AC 5.4 Android Development Standards

## Introduction

This curriculum is developed under the pretense that entering fellows will have no prior knowledge of Software Development (specifically Java or Android) beyond what was introduced to them during the two-day Javascript intensive/workshop prior to the offer of admission. 

The Pursuit Android Development Fellowship Technical Mastery facet begins with the fundamentals of the Java programming language (Java 8), and introductory Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms in Unit 1, in conjunction with POSIX-styled command line version control (Git and Github) and JetBrains IDE development skills (Intellij IDEA and Android Studio, respectively). 

Units 2 through 6 will focus primarily on the design and development of a number of group-based Android Applications, bookended by a Practical assessment.

From the start of Unit 7, Android fellows will have built a group project under the crucible of a two-day hackathon challenge, along with a group capstone project culminating in a public presentation, and a personal portfolio project up until commencement (the end of Unit 10), to round off their academic prospectus. 

Parallel to the Android development course, fellows will have a competitive level of exposure to data structures and algorithms materials, to prepare them for both whiteboarding interviews and over-the-phone/codeshare technical interviews.
