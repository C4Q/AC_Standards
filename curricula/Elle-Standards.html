 <h2>Language Fundamentals [LF]</h2>


  <h3>Data Types</h3>
    <strong>LF.1</strong> Understand and differentiate among types of data, including selecting the correct type for the task, type casting where necessary, and applying the correct methods and operators for the type.

    Apply methods and other operations based on appropriate data type to produce desired outcomes.

        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Objects</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Know the truthy and falsey conditions for each data type</p>

  <h3>Data Structures<h3>
    Access individual elements within sets of information, either directly, by iteration, or using methods.

  <h3>Variables</h3>
    <strong>LF.2</strong> Understand that a variable/constant is a reference to a value stored in memory. Know how to declare and assign variables and constants. Understand the differences and appropriate use cases for variables vs constant.

  <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    <strong>LF.3</strong> Understand that code runs from top to bottom unless control flow is utilized. Understand the logic of control flow including if/else, switch/case, comparison operators, and loops. Navigate intermediate to complex control flow structures to produce desired outcomes for particular inputs.

    <ul>
      <li>for</li>
      <li>for/in</li>
      <li>while</li>
      <li>do while</li>
    </ul>

    ios
    <ul>
    <li>for-in</li>
    <li>while</li>
    <li>repeat-while</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.4</strong> Understand how functions enable us to call a block of reusable code. Define and call functions. Understand the components of a function signature. Utilize functions effectively to recycle functionalities across modules and keep code DRY.</p>

    Functions and scope (including: definition vs. invocation, terminology - e.g. 'argument', etc - function and variable scoping, helper functions and the philosophy of conciseness)


    <h3>Closures</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.5</strong> Understand the purpose of using closures. Recognize that a function is a type of closure. Understand closure syntax. Solve problems by using functions that take a closure as an argument. Understand that closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.</p>

    <h3>Scope</h3>

  <summary>Git and GitHub</summary>
  <p>We expect students to know all foundational Git commands, best practices, and terminology, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic Git commands (at least: 'init', 'add', 'commit', 'diff', 'push', 'status', 'history', 'pull', 'log', 'branch', 'checkout', 'clone', 'remote')</li>
    <li>Basic Git/GitHub terminology and underlying concepts (at least: 'repository', 'clone', 'fork', 'branch', 'staged', 'commit', 'merge', 'merge conflict', '.git', '.gitignore', 'pull request')
    <li>Conceptual understanding of GitHub collaboration and best practices (at least: the difference between Git and GitHub, QA/feature branches versus master branch, the importance of readme files, the pull request/review/approval cycle, how to avoid merge conflicts)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Accordingly, we expect students to be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create GitHub accounts and link them to their Git installations in the command line</li>
    <li>Create, clone, and remove Git repositories anywhere they have permission to on their systems</li>
    <li>Add files and commit with descriptive messages to a remote repository</li>
    <li>See changes, commits, and commit history in the command line and revert to previous commits if necessary</li>
    <li>Pull updates from a remote repository</li>
    <li>Create, update, checkout, and push branches</li>
    <li>Submit, annotate, comment on, and approve pull requests on GitHub</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<h3>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving<sub> 1<sub></h3>
<p><strong>EP. </strong>Identify a problem or challenge, conceptualize a way (or multiple ways) to approach it, consider potential effects of additional factors, and test different solutions until they find one that works. Break down complex problems into their component parts, form hypotheses to test them, consider the effects of additional factors, and eliminate potential problems one by one.
</p>

<p><strong>EP. </strong>Know how to find a plausible answer independently: Identify essential requirements that define the answer that needs to be solved, based on users, stakeholders, and constraints, single out missing information and determine the best way to find it, whether through existing resources, an online search, available libraries, etc., sort through varied information to determine what’s useful and reliable, and use those resources to learn something new, figure out a problem, and/ or locate additional helpful resources.</p>

<p>Deal effectively with dead ends, frustration: Demonstrate ability to overcome frustration effectively. When one approach doesn’t work, rather than becoming despondent or giving up, able to take a step back, regroup, and try a different way.<p>

<p>Strong desire and ability to learn: Demonstrate the desire and ability to find and learn new material. Must be able to conduct effective research (find and sort through various resources to find useful, reliable information) and teach themselves new material in an ever-evolving  field. This includes learning and being able to apply new languages to solve business problems.<p>

<p>Curiosity: Part of being a good problem-solver is an inherent curiosity that
drives people to want to uncover and overcome new frontiers in the  rst place. As a result, many employers look for an indication of curiosity in their employees, and may ask di erent types of questions to gauge this during an interview, from review of tech-related personal/side projects and non-tech extracurriculars to inquiries about a candidate’s reading list.</p>
