<h1>Core Standards</h2>
 <h2>Language Fundamentals [LF]</h2>

  <h3>Native Data Types</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.1</strong> Understand and differentiate among types of data, including selecting the correct type for the task, type casting where necessary, and applying the correct methods and operators for the type. Apply methods and other operations based on appropriate data type to produce desired outcomes.<p>
    <details>

      <ul>
        <li>Numbers</li>
        <li>Strings</li>
        <li>Booleans</li>
        <li>Objects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Utilize core methods and operators (including: string methods, arithmetic operators and Math methods, object methods). Know the truthy and falsey conditions for each data type.</p>

            <li>Concatenating Strings and Characters</li>
            <li>String Interpolation</li>
            <li>Comparing Strings</li>
            <li>Creating a String from a File or URL</li>
            <li>Writing to a File or URL</li>

          </ul>
        <li>Bools</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

  <h3>Data Structures</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.2</strong>Understand that data structures are ways of storing multiple elements of associated data. Access individual elements within sets of information, either directly, by iteration, or using methods.<p>

  <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.3</strong> Understand that a variable/constant is a reference to a value stored in memory. Know how to declare and assign variables and constants. Understand the differences and appropriate use cases for variables vs constant.</p>

  <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.4</strong> Understand that code runs from top to bottom unless control flow is utilized. Understand the logic of control flow including if/else, switch/case, comparison operators, and loops. Navigate intermediate to complex control flow structures to produce desired outcomes for particular inputs.<p>

        <li>repeat-while</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.4</strong> Understand how functions enable us to call a block of reusable code. Define and call functions. Understand the components of a function signature. Utilize functions effectively to recycle functionalities across modules and keep code DRY.</p>

    Functions and scope (including: definition vs. invocation, terminology - e.g. 'argument', etc - function and variable scoping, helper functions and the philosophy of conciseness)


    <h3>Closures</h3>
    <p><strong>LF.5</strong> Understand the purpose of using closures. Recognize that a function is a type of closure. Understand closure syntax. Solve problems by using functions that take a closure as an argument. Understand that closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.</p>

    <h3>Scope</h3>
