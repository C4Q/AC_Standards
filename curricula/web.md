## Full Stack Web Development Standards

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline, specifically, standards for the Full Stack Web Development curriculum at Pursuit. This is not meant to be a full-fledged curriculum, nor is it meant to articulate the structure, order, or content of the Full Stack Web Development program.

This outlines, specifically, the information we expect Full Stack Web graduates to know and the things we expect them to be able to do. It will be split into three separate parts:

* Foundational Programming Concepts
* Frontend Understanding
* Backend Understanding

This structure will let us specify what concepts belong where, which will give us a better overview of how to schedule/what to prioritize.

Without further ado:

## Foundational Programming Concepts

<details>
  <summary>The Command Line</summary>
  <p>We expect students to know all important terms and concepts related to the basic implementation and usage of the bash terminal, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Difference between CLI and GUI</li>
    <li>Basic filesystem navigation and manipulation (at least: 'ls', 'cd', 'touch', 'mkdir', 'rm')</li>
    <li>System-level environment variables - what they are and how to manipulate them (more on this in the Node section)</li>
    <li>Basic bash commands (e.g. 'sudo', 'which') and shorthand (at least: '-v', '-u', '-a', '--help')</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Accordingly, we expect students to be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Navigate to any folder/file in the terminal when asked</li>
    <li>Create a file/folder anywhere they have permission to in their filesystem</li>
    <li>Install any software with CLI support and be able to utilize it with documentation</li>
    <li>Discern what software they have installed globally, what version it is, and how to update/uninstall/reinstall as necessary</li>
  </ul>
</details>
