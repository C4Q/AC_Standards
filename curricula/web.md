## Full Stack Web Development Standards

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline, specifically, standards for the Full Stack Web Development curriculum at Pursuit. This is not meant to be a full-fledged curriculum, nor is it meant to articulate the structure, order, or content of the Full Stack Web Development program.

This outlines, specifically, the information we expect Full Stack Web graduates to know and the things we expect them to be able to do. It will be split into three separate parts:

* Foundational Programming Concepts
* Frontend Understanding
* Backend Understanding

This structure will let us specify what concepts belong where, which will give us a better overview of how to schedule/what to prioritize.

Without further ado:

## Foundational Programming Concepts
