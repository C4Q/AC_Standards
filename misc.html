<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>We expect fellows to understand the principles of Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>encapsulation</p>
<p>polymorphism</p>
<p>inheritance</p>


<h2>Functional Programming</h2>


<h2>App architecture - Model, View, Controller (MVC)</h2>
<p>We expect fellows to understand how to use MVC pattern to design an iOS app. Understand that MVC is a very common app architecture but there are other options used by the industry, e.g MVVM. MVC is heavily used by Apple.

Components of MVC:
</p>


<p>Model: the data needed by your app</p>
<p>View: visual aspects of the user interface</p>
<p>Controller: the messenger (glue) between the views and the models</p>
<br>

<h2>REST-ful APIs, JSON, and AJAX</h2>
  <p><strong>FSW.5</strong> Deep knowledge of and familiarity with REST-ful APIs. Build a frontend application that queries remote APIs to render information to the user.</p>

    <p><strong>FSW.5.a</strong> Know HTTP and the request-response cycle.</p>

    <p><strong>FSW.5.b</strong> Utilize GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests and the difference between them. Utilize CRUD requests to create, update, or delete information from an API.</p>

    <p><strong>FSW.5.c</strong> Utilize various libraries/services to make AJAX requests to APIs (including fetch, axios, XMLHttpRequest).</p>

    <p><strong>FSW.5.d</strong> Understand API routing, wildcards, and formatting appropriate requests in order to query an API in Postman or the browser to get a desired response.</p>

    <p><strong>FSW.5.e</strong> Able to navigate new API documentation to discern how an API might be useful in a project.</p>

    <p><strong>FSW.5.e</strong> Know how to handle, parse, and represent data received in JSON format.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>HTTP/APIs</h2>
    <p>We expect fellows to be abke to start making requests to the internet and web APIs. Fellows should have a basic understanding of how the internet works. The basic understanding concepts includes: </p>

    <p>Understand how the internet works</p>
    <p>Know the following HTTP verbs: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE</p>
    <p>Be familiar with response status codes: 100 -> 500</p>
    <p>Understand what is a RESTFul API</p>
    <p>Know how to use URLSession along with URLRequest to make requests to external web APIs</p>
    We expect fellows to know how to manage API keys and keeping them safe.

    <h2>How the Internet Works</h2>
    <p><strong>FSW.11</strong> Understanding the physical and conceptual structure of the Internet. Explain, in detail, what happens when you type 'www.google.com' into a browser and press enter.</p>

      <p><strong>FSW.11.a</strong> An awareness of physical infrastructure, including servers and cables</p>

      <p><strong>FSW.11.b</strong> Understand DNS routing, servers, HTTP, and the request-response cycle.</p>

      <p><strong>FSW.11.c</strong> Understand and handle various errors based on specific HTTP error codes.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Parsing JSON</h2>
      <p> iOS JSON is the popular format in which response data is retrieved from web request. We expect fellows to perform various HTTP request to get back JSON data. </p>
      <p>iOS Use JSONDecoder / JSONEncoder along with Codable to parse JSON data</p>
      <h2>iOS POST request</h2>
      <p>We expect fellows to be able to use URLRequest and URLSession to make a POST request to a Web API</p>

      <h2>iOS Error handling</h2>
      <p>We expect fellows to know how to process, respond and recover from error conditions in your program.</p>

      <p>Propagating errors using throwing functions</p>
      <p>Handling errors using do-catch</p>
      <p>converting errors to optional values</p>
