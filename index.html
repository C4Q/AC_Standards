      <h1>Pursuit Core Program Standards</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>These standards define what fellows should understand and be able to do upon completion of the Pursuit Core program. These standards were developed from our work with subject matter experts in the New York tech industry, our Brain Trust, and our experience training hundreds of fellows. The goal of these standards is to provide the most current and practical understanding of the key abilities needed by a successful junior developer across a variety of company sizes, industries, and team structures.</p>

      <h2>Our Three Pillars</h2>

      <p>The foundation of the Core program is the three pillars: Tech Mastery, Professional Skills, and Industry Fluency. We ensure that each of fellows completes Core, with not only a strong technical training, but also the professional skills to be an outstanding team member and leader, and the industry fluency to be comfortable and well rounded upon joining the tech industry. </p>

      <h3>Professional Skills</h3>
      <p>All fellows complete the Professional Skills training through a variety of workshops, experiences, and work products throughout Core.</p>

      <h3>Industry Fluency</h3>
      <p>All fellows complete the Industry Fluency training through a variety of guest speaker workshops, tech talks, and industry treks throughout Core.</p>
