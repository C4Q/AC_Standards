      <h1>Pursuit Core Program Standards</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>These standards define the technical and professionals skills fellows should have acquired upon completion of Pursuit Core. Based on our experience training hundreds of fellows and with the guidance of subject matter experts in the New York tech industry and our Brain Trust, these standards provide the most current practical understanding of the key abilities needed junior developers to succeed across company of various sizes and different industries and team structures.</p>

      <h2>Our Three Pillars</h2>

      <p>We work to ensure that all fellows who complete Core have the technical mastery, professional skills, and industry fluency needed to succeed in the tech industry.</p>

      <h3>Professional Skills</h3>
      <p>All fellows complete the professional skills training through workshops, experiences, and work products that enable them to build their personal brand, sharpen their interview skills, and navigate the professional environment.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>Industry Fluency</h3>
      <p>All fellows complete industry fluency training through workshops with industry professionals, tech talks, and industry treks throughout Core. This enables them to expand their networks and learn about venture capital, entrepreneurship, and innovative topics like blockchain and machine learning.</p>
